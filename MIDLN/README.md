# MIDLN

### Official pytorch implementation of the paper: "Multi-physical Interpretable Deep Learning Network for Oil Spill Identification Based on SAR Images". 

## Code

### Install dependencies

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This code was tested with python 3.8 


###   Model training
To train MIDLN model on your own training images, put the training images under mydata/images/train, and run

```
python train.py
```
###  ASG-CAExplainer run
To train ASG-CAExplainer model on your own test images, put the training images under mydata/images/test, and run

```
python ASG-CAExplainer.py
```
